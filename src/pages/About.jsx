          <p>
            I am from Utah, born and raised. I have earned my Associates Degree
            in University Studies in Science. I am working on furthering my
            education by attending the University of Utah Bootcamp for coding.
            Currently, I'm working for small motorcycle dealership located in
            Springville. In my free time I enjoy spending time in the outdoors,
            spending time with family and friends, and going to the movies.
